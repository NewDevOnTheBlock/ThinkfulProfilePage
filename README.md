# ThinkfulProfilePage
A culmination of HTML/CSS techniques I leanred during thinkful, put into action in a page about my developer journey and my personal interests

This profile page is an amalgamation of all my html/css skills I've recently learned and are still trying to develop. 
I included a header with my meta info
I have a main page with all of my info about my journey and where I've been + where I'm going
I linked my linkedin and github pages to it
