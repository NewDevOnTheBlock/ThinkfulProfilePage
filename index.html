                        <li>I'm always trying to find a way to make everything I do, and I mean everything, feel like a good time.</li>

                        <li>I love videogames, which has kind of helped inspire my journey into coding.</li>

                        <h3 class="title white-text">My current life:</h3>
                        <p class="white-text">I recently got into web development about 3 months ago, and have had an interesting journey. I thoroughly enjoy the kind of work
                            that I've been doing with my coding bootcamp. It's really opened up my mind toward new ways of thinking and problem solving. I've worked more kinds of jobs than I can count such as office jobs,
                            custodial work, kitchen work, retail, and more. I've worked with teams as small as 4 people to workforces that number in the hundreds, I've even worked by myself at some jobs. I've worked
                            in leadership positions, and of course, worked in entry level positions as well. But the biggest thing about work is that I've worked with all types of interesting people from all walks of life.
                            I feel I'm very malleable and can be taught just about anything, by just about anyone, and now that I'm learning to code I truly think that I've found what might be my calling in life.
                        </p>
                        <p class="white-text">Outside of web development, my hobbies include hanging out with my friends, playing videogames, learning about random things, studying vedanta (as well as other interesting philosophies) and spending
                            time with my girlfriend, Mallory, who has been an awesome support throughout the 7 years we've been together. Also, I genuinely enjoy working out, as someone who was <b>124 pounds</b> when I started, I take a 
                            small bit of pride in knowing that I've put on <i>30 pounds</i> since I started working out regularly.
